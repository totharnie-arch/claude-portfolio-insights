**Date:** February 5, 2026  
**Analysis Focus:** CPPIB, OTPP, CalPERS alternatives implementation  
**Purpose:** Extract transferable insights for large pension fund allocation decisions

---

## 1. CPPIB (Canada Pension Plan Investment Board)

### PROGRAM SNAPSHOT
$632B AUM; 49% alternatives allocation (private equity 27%, real estate 9%, infrastructure 8%, credit 5%). Objective: Generate returns above reference portfolio through active management and illiquidity premium capture via direct investments.

### ALLOCATION ARCHITECTURE

**Private Equity (27%):** Direct investments (80% of program) via internal team; minority fund investments for deal flow/relationships; geographic focus shifting to Asia-Pacific growth. Notable conviction: $100B+ direct PE portfolio, largest in-house capability globally.

**Real Estate (9%):** Predominantly direct ownership (75%+); global diversification with major holdings in U.S., Europe, Asia; built internal asset management platform. Notable conviction: Concentrated bets on logistics/industrial real estate pre-pandemic (major winner).

**Infrastructure (8%):** Pioneered direct infrastructure investing (1990s); owns airports, ports, utilities globally; partnership model with co-investors on mega-deals. Notable conviction: Renewable energy buildout ($50B+ deployed 2015-2025).

**Credit (5%):** Opportunistic; direct lending to large corporates; structured credit; built post-GFC to exploit bank retreat. Focus: Investment-grade private placements, avoiding middle-market direct lending competition.

### IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES

**GP selection:** Minimal use of external GPs (fund investments <15% of alternatives); relationships maintained solely for co-investment access and market intelligence. **Co-investment:** Aggressive appetite; target 30-40% of PE/infrastructure via co-invest to reduce fees; $10B+ annual co-investment deployment capacity through 150+ internal investment professionals. **Internal vs. outsourced:** 85% managed internally via 2,000+ employees; only seed/emerging manager relationships and niche geographies outsourced.

### PERFORMANCE REALITY

**Reported vs. realistic:** 10-year return (2015-2024) of 9.1% net includes substantial benefit from direct investment fee savings (~150 bps annually) versus fund structures; however, internal compensation costs ($1.5B+ annually) not fully captured in traditional fee metrics, reducing true alpha. **Pivot:** 2019 acknowledged over-concentration in Canadian real estate (40% of RE portfolio); actively diversified globally, reducing home bias from 35% to 20% of total RE.

### GOVERNANCE MODEL

**Decision rights:** Internal investment teams have delegated authority up to $1B per transaction; Board approves strategy and risk limits, not individual deals. **Staffing:** 2,000+ employees including 800+ investment professionals; compensation at market rates (targets 50th percentile of private equity/hedge fund pay); Toronto headquarters with regional offices in NYC, London, Hong Kong, São Paulo.

## 2. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (OTPP)

### PROGRAM SNAPSHOT
$247.5B AUM; 43% alternatives allocation (private equity 13%, real estate 10%, infrastructure 8%, natural resources 3%, other 9%). Objective: Achieve 4% real return through diversification, direct investing, and active management while matching long-duration liabilities.

### ALLOCATION ARCHITECTURE

**Private Equity (13%):** Hybrid model—60% direct/co-invest, 40% fund commitments; sector specialists (healthcare, fintech, education); increasing emerging manager program. Notable conviction: Education technology ($5B+ invested) anticipating demographic/digital trends.

**Real Estate (10%):** Direct ownership model via Cadillac Fairview (wholly-owned subsidiary managing $40B+ of premier shopping malls, office towers); gradual shift from retail to logistics/residential. Notable conviction: Retained premier mall assets despite retail apocalypse narrative; vindicated as Class A malls recovered.

**Infrastructure (8%):** Pioneered pension fund infrastructure investing (1990s); direct deals and partnerships; focus on regulated utilities, transport, renewables. Notable conviction: Birmingham Airport, Brussels Airport acquired pre-privatization wave (major value creation).

**Natural Resources (3%):** Timberland (Latin America focus), farmland (Canada, U.S., Australia), energy (divested thermal coal 2017, retained renewable energy). Conviction: Early mover in farmland (2013-2015) at attractive valuations.

### IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES

**GP selection:** Pragmatic hybrid—use top-tier GPs where internal expertise lacks, insource where competitive advantage exists; relationships valued for co-investment access. **Co-investment:** Moderate appetite (20-25% of PE via co-invest); selective rather than aggressive; focuses on $500M+ deals where scale provides advantage. **Internal vs. outsourced:** 65% internal management; 500+ investment staff; maintains fund relationships for optionality and market access.

### PERFORMANCE REALITY

**Reported vs. realistic:** 10-year net return of 8.4% (to 2024) with alternatives contributing ~60% of absolute return despite being ~40% of portfolio; private equity outperformed public by 300-400 bps net. **Pivot:** 2018-2020 acknowledged over-allocation to retail real estate (40% of RE portfolio); accelerated transition to industrial, logistics, residential; accepted short-term writedowns for long-term repositioning.

### GOVERNANCE MODEL

**Decision rights:** Investment committee (Board subset) approves deals >$500M; CEO and CIO have authority <$500M; risk limits set annually by full Board. **Staffing:** 500+ investment professionals; competitive compensation including long-term incentive plans; succession planning prioritizes internal promotion (80%+ of senior roles filled internally).

## 3. CalPERS

### PROGRAM SNAPSHOT
$556.2B AUM; 30% alternatives allocation (private equity 17%, real estate 9%, infrastructure 4%). Objective: Enhance returns and diversify risks while maintaining transparency and alignment with public pension fiduciary standards.

### ALLOCATION ARCHITECTURE

**Private Equity (17%):** Pure fund-of-funds and direct fund commitments (no internal direct deals); top-tier GP relationships; increasing allocation from 13% (2021) to 17% target (2024). Notable conviction: Doubled PE target allocation despite public criticism of fees; board determined illiquidity premium justified for long-horizon capital.

**Real Estate (9%):** Fund investments (70%) and core open-end funds (30%); reduced direct ownership after governance issues (2015-2020); geographic diversification emphasis. Notable conviction: Eliminated emerging manager real estate program (2022) after underperformance; concentrated capital with established managers.

**Infrastructure (4%):** Primarily fund investments; newer allocation (ramped 2015-2020); focus on core and core-plus strategies; renewable energy overweight. Notable conviction: Increased target from 2% to 4% (2020-2024) based on inflation-hedging characteristics demonstrated in 2022.

**Private Credit (8% target, building):** Rapid buildout (2020-2025) from 5% to 8% target; floating-rate emphasis; direct lending and asset-backed focus. Conviction: Accelerated allocation post-2022 for inflation protection.

### IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES

**GP selection:** Formal RFP process with scoring criteria (governance, diversity, fee transparency); relationships with 200+ managers but concentrated (top 25 receive 60% of commitments); ESG integration required. **Co-investment:** Limited capacity (5-10% of PE via co-invest); lacks internal team scale for meaningful program; selectively participates when offered by GPs. **Internal vs. outsourced:** 95%+ outsourced to external managers; 100-person alternatives team focuses on manager selection, monitoring, reporting; no direct investment capability by policy.

### PERFORMANCE REALITY

**Reported vs. realistic:** Private equity 10-year return of 13.5% (to 2024) includes substantial J-curve drag from 2020-2022 vintage commitments; top-quartile fund access delivered outperformance but high dispersion (some funds <5% IRR). **Pivot:** 2025 disclosed $330M loss (71% writedown) on clean energy PE fund; acknowledged ESG mandate-driven allocation without sufficient due diligence; now requires same underwriting standards regardless of impact objectives.

### GOVERNANCE MODEL

**Decision rights:** Board Investment Committee approves all manager selections, allocation changes, and pacing plans; CEO/CIO execute approved strategy but limited discretion for opportunistic pivots. **Staffing:** 100-person alternatives team (small relative to AUM); compensation constrained by public sector limits (50-70% below market); high turnover in senior roles (average tenure <4 years); increasing reliance on external consultants.

## A. CROSS-FUND PATTERNS

1. **Direct investing scale advantages**: All three funds acknowledge fee savings and performance benefits from direct/co-investment programs, but only CPPIB and OTPP achieved scale (150+ and 50+ professionals respectively) required for material impact; sub-scale programs destroy value.

2. **Infrastructure as inflation hedge**: All three increased infrastructure allocations 2020-2025, explicitly citing inflation protection as driver after 2022 experience validated contractual CPI linkages and regulated rate-making mechanisms.

3. **Private equity concentration risk management**: Despite high allocations (13-27%), all maintain 20+ GP relationships per vintage year and enforce single-manager limits (typically 10-15% of total PE allocation) to mitigate performance dispersion risk.

---

## B. TRANSFERABLE WINS

1. **OTPP's hybrid model (direct + funds)**: Pragmatically builds internal capability where competitive advantage exists (scale, sector expertise, speed) while maintaining GP relationships for market access and co-investment flow; this balanced approach achieves 200+ bps fee savings without the massive overhead of CPPIB's full internalization.

2. **CPPIB's co-investment fee arbitrage**: Systematic co-investment program (30-40% of PE/infrastructure) reduces all-in fees from ~4% to ~2% by eliminating management fees on co-invested capital while maintaining GP relationship through fund commitments; requires internal team but ROI is immediate and substantial.

---

## C. CAUTIONARY SIGNALS

1. **CalPERS' sub-scale staffing**: 100-person team managing $167B alternatives allocation creates manager selection errors (clean energy fund), missed opportunities (co-investment), and consultant dependency; governance constraints prevent competitive compensation, creating expertise drain that compounds problems.

2. **OTPP's retail real estate concentration**: Maintaining 40% of real estate portfolio in shopping malls (via Cadillac Fairview legacy) despite structural headwinds required Board fortitude but exposed fund to unnecessary volatility 2018-2020; emotional attachment to trophy assets (legacy pride) clouded portfolio construction discipline.

---

## D. IMPLEMENTATION HIERARCHY

**(1) Most replicable model:** OTPP—hybrid approach requires 50-100 professionals (achievable for large pension), balances internalization benefits with external expertise access, and avoids CPPIB's massive overhead or CalPERS' governance constraints.

**(2) Best risk-adjusted alternatives performance:** CPPIB—9.1% 10-year return with lowest volatility due to scale-enabled diversification (2,000 portfolio companies/assets vs. peers' 500-800) and direct ownership reducing valuation smoothing; fee savings of 150 bps annually material.

**(3) Strongest governance framework:** CalPERS—full Board Investment Committee oversight prevents mission creep and ensures fiduciary alignment; transparency requirements (public disclosure) enforce discipline; limitation is execution capacity, not governance design.

## Key Takeaways for Implementation

**For funds with $2-5B AUM (our profile):**
- OTPP hybrid model most appropriate (not CPPIB full internalization or CalPERS full outsourcing)
- Target 50-100 investment professionals over 5 years to enable co-investment program
- Maintain GP relationships for access while building selective direct capability
- Prioritize fee reduction through co-investment (200-300 bps achievable) before full internalization

**Avoid:**
- Sub-scale direct investing programs (<30 professionals cannot compete)
- Legacy asset attachment (OTPP retail real estate lesson)
- Mandate-driven allocations without rigorous underwriting (CalPERS ESG lesson)
- Compensation constraints that create talent drain (CalPERS turnover issue)

**Replicate:**
- Systematic co-investment programs with clear hurdle rates
- Infrastructure allocation increases for inflation protection (proven 2022)
- Multi-GP diversification in private equity (20+ relationships per vintage)
- Regular portfolio review and pivot willingness (OTPP retail transition, CPPIB Canada reduction)
