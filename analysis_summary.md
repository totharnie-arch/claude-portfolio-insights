# Pension Fund Portfolio Enhancement: Analysis Summary

**Date:** February 2026 | **For:** Senior Investment Strategy Team

## The Problem

The 60/40 portfolio's core assumption—stocks and bonds diversify each other—broke in 2022. Both fell simultaneously (-18% equities, -13% bonds), producing a -17.5% portfolio loss. Stock-bond correlation flipped from -0.5 to +0.5, and portfolio volatility jumped from 7.7% to 10.4%.

---

## Historical 60/40 Performance

8.7% average annual return (1960–2023), powered by a 40-year bond bull market. The "golden age" (1980–2000) delivered ~15% annually. Recent decade: 6.9%. The strategy recovered post-2022, but the structural tailwinds—falling rates, negative correlation, low inflation—may not return.

---

## What We Tested

Added a 10% allocation to each alternative (funded from bonds: 60/30/10 split) using public ETF proxies over ~15 years (2011–2026).

| Alternative | Proxy | Ann. Return | Sharpe | Max Drawdown |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Baseline 60/40** | SPY/AGG | 9.46% | 0.77 | -21.7% |
| **+Infrastructure** | IGF | **10.06%** | **0.80** | -25.2% |
| **+Private Credit** | BKLN | 9.60% | 0.77 | -23.5% |
| **+REITs** | VNQ | 10.00% | 0.73 | -25.7% |
| **+Real Assets** | Composite | 9.49% | 0.76 | -23.6% |

## 2022 Stress Test

Infrastructure lost the least (-14.4%) during the inflation shock. Real Assets and Private Credit were close behind (~-14.6%). REITs performed worst (-17.0%). All alternatives outperformed the 60/40 baseline (-15.6%).

---

## Statistical Significance

Only Infrastructure's improvement was statistically significant (p=0.007). Private Credit, REITs, and Real Assets showed directional improvement but did not clear the 5% or 10% significance thresholds.

---

## Sensitivity Check

Winner depends on volatility assumptions. With appraisal smoothing (realistic for private markets): **Infrastructure wins**. Without smoothing (pessimistic): **Private Credit wins**. Recommendation is sensitive to this choice—moderate confidence.

---

## Correlation Findings

| Alternative | Corr. to Equity | Corr. to Bonds |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure | 0.80 | 0.13 |
| Private Credit | 0.60 | 0.07 |
| REITs | 0.74 | 0.21 |
| Real Assets | 0.71 | 0.03 |

Public proxies show higher equity correlation than private market indices suggest. Private Credit and Real Assets offer the lowest bond correlation.

---

## Peer Benchmarks

CPPIB (49% alternatives), OTPP (43%), and CalPERS (30%) all increased infrastructure allocations post-2022, citing proven inflation protection. OTPP's hybrid model (direct + funds) is most replicable for our fund size.

---

## Recommendation

**Infrastructure is the top priority.** Strongest risk-adjusted improvement, only statistically significant result, and best 2022 crisis performance. Target 5–8% allocation over 2–3 years.

**Full long-term target: 25% alternatives** (8% infrastructure, 5% private credit, 5% REITs, 4% real assets, 3% private real estate) reducing 60/40 to roughly 42/25.

---

## Key Caveats

Public ETF proxies overstate volatility and correlation for private assets. True private infrastructure likely performs better than IGF suggests. Results are directional—validate with institutional-grade data (EDHECinfra, NCREIF, Cliffwater) before committing capital.
